# Create SpecializationGroup
# open every link from PAGE1 SEE ABOVE

# Create a Schedule for each group
# ? not sure about anymore maybe in phase one we won't need it
# maybe we can create a schdule for each student, the initial one will be the one crate
# by the faculty and then the student can add more course dates
# but in phase we won't do that


# Create all Groups for specializations
# Create Course Date

# first crate schdule then add it to group by creating SchduleGroup Object
